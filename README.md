# Hangman-with-two-players-python
This is a program based on the old and classic Hangman game. It requires two players, one for giving the word and one for guessing it.

-The file named "hangman(file).py" is using the file "words_alpha.txt" which contains 479k English words, and it's used to validate the existance of the given word.
-The file named "hangman(website).py" is exaclty the same with "hangman(file).py" with the exception that it uses a web page in  order to validate the word given. Because of that you don't have to download the file "words_alpha.txt" in order to execute the program.

Have fun!
