# Hangman-with-two-players-python
This is a program based on the old and classic Hangman game.It requires two players, one for giving the word and one for guessing it.
-The file named "hangman(file).py" is using the file "words_alpha.txt" which contains 479k English words for checking the validation of the word given.
-The file named "hangman(website).py" is exaclty the same with "hangman(file).py" with the exception that it uses, a web page in  order to check the validation of the word given, so you don't need to download the file "words_alpha.txt" in order to execute the program.
Have fun!
